          <p>Effective date: <strong>October 11, 2017</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for entrusting HassanAndAssociates page with your personal information. Holding onto your private information is a serious responsibility, and we want you to know how we're handling it.</p>

<p>We collect your information only with your consent; we only collect the minimum amount of personal information that is necessary to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with us; we don't sell it to third parties; and we only use it as this Privacy Statement describes.</p>

<p>Of course, the short version doesn't tell you everything, so please read on for more details!</p>

<p>If you're <strong>just browsing the website</strong>, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs. This is stuff we collect from everybody, whether they have an account or not.</p>

<p>The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.</p>

<p>We collect this information to better understand how our website visitors use HassanAndAssociates page, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.</p>

<p>"User Personal Information" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her. Information such as a name, an email address are examples of “User Personal Information.”</p>

<p>User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service.</p>

<ul>
<li>We use your User Personal Information, specifically your name, to identify you on HassanAndAssociates page.</li>
<li>We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Statement.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not intentionally collect <strong>sensitive personal information</strong>, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although HassanAndAssociates page does not request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information in your account.</p>

<p>We do not intentionally collect information or other free-form content inputs. Information in the form belongs to you, and you are responsible for it, as well as for making sure that your content complies with our Terms of Service</a>, HassanAndAssociates page employees do not access private information unless required to</a> for security or maintenance, or for support reasons.</p>

<p>If you're a <strong>child under the age of 13</strong>, you may not have visit on HassanAndAssociates page. HassanAndAssociates page does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to try stop your visiting. We don't want to discourage you from learning to law, but those are the rules. Please see our <a href="https://hassanandassociates.biz/files/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a> for information.</p>

<p>We <strong>do not</strong> share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for their commercial purposes.</p>

<p>We do not disclose User Personal Information outside HassanAndAssociates, except in the situations listed in the relavent section on Compelled Disclosure</a>.</p>

<p>We <strong>do</strong> share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use HassanAndAssociates, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as our conferences or events.</a>. However, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers.</p>

<p>We do not host advertising on HassanAndAssociates. We may occasionally embed content from third party sites, such as YouTube, and that content may include ads. While we try to minimize the amount of ads our embedded content contains, we can't always control what third parties show.</p>

<p>We may share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested.</p>

<p>We may share User Personal Information with a limited number of third-party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own Privacy policy. Our vendors perform services such as payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, and other similar services. When we transfer your data to our vendors</a>, we remain responsible for it.</p>

<p>We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we have made in our Privacy Policy or in our Terms of Use.</p>

<p>Much of HassanAndAssociates is public-facing. If your content is public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of Use. We do not sell that content; it is yours. However, we do allow third parties, such as research organizations or archives, to compile public-facing HassanAndAssociates page information.</p>

<p>Your Personal Information, associated with your content, may be gathered by third parties in these compilations of HassanAndAssociates data. If you do not want your Personal Information to appear in third parties’ compilations of HassanAndAssociates page data, please do not make your Personal Information publicly available and be sure not to enter your email address in the HassanAndAssociates page.</p>

<p>If you would like to compile HassanAndAssociates data, you may only use any public-facing Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our user has authorized it. For example, where a HassanAndAssociates user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from HassanAndAssociates page, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from HassanAndAssociates or HassanAndAssociates users.</p>

<p>HassanAndAssociates page uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful. We use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of HassanAndAssociates page.</p>

<p>A cookie is a small piece of text that our web server stores on your computer or mobile device, which your browser sends to us when you return to our site. Cookies do not necessarily identify you if you are merely visiting HassanAndAssociates; however, a cookie may store a unique identifier for each logged in user. The cookies HassanAndAssociates sets are essential for the operation of the website, or are used for performance or functionality. By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device’s ability to accept cookies, you will not be able to log in or use HassanAndAssociates’s services.</p>

<p>We use Google Analytics as a third party tracking service, but we don’t use it to track you individually or collect your User Personal Information. We use Google Analytics to collect information about how our website performs and how our users, in general, navigate through and use HassanAndAssociates page. This helps us evaluate our users' use of HassanAndAssociates; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve our content and website performance.</p>

<p>Google Analytics gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, time stamp, and similar data about your use of HassanAndAssociates page. We do not link this information to any of your personal information such as your name.</p>

<p>HassanAndAssociates will not, nor will we allow any third party to, use the Google Analytics tool to track our users individually; collect any User Personal Information other than IP address; or correlate your IP address with your identity. Google provides further information about its own privacy practices and offers a <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">browser add-on to opt out of Google Analytics tracking</a>.</p>

<p>Certain pages on our site may set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content, such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. While we try to minimize these third party cookies, we can’t always control what cookies this third party content sets.</p>

<p>"<a href="http://donottrack.us/">Do Not Track</a>" is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of information about your online activity from third party tracking services. We do not track your online browsing activity on other online services over time and we do not permit third-party services to track your activity on our site beyond our basic Google Analytics tracking, which you may opt out of <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>. Because we do not share this kind of data with third party services or permit this kind of third party data collection on HassanAndAssociates page for any of our users, and we do not track our users on third-party websites ourselves, we do not need to respond differently to an individual browser's Do Not Track setting.</p>

<p>If you are interested in turning on your browser’s privacy and Do Not Track settings, the <a href="http://donottrack.us/">Do Not Track</a> website has browser-specific instructions.</p>

<p>HassanAndAssociates page takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.</p>

<p>No method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. For more information.</p>

<p>We provide the same standard of privacy protection to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we work hard to comply with the applicable data privacy laws wherever we do business. Additionally, we require that if our vendors or affiliates have access to User Personal Information, they must comply with our privacy policies and with applicable data privacy laws, including signing data transfer agreements such as Standard Contractual Clause agreements.</p>

<p>In particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>  HassanAndAssociates page provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent at the time of data collection, when we do collect your personal data.</li>
<li>  We collect only the minimum amount of personal data necessary, unless you choose to provide more. We encourage you to only give us the amount of data you are comfortable sharing.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have concerns about the way HassanAndAssociates page is handling your User Personal Information, please let us know immediately. We want to help. You may contact us by filling out the contact form or by e-mail.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that a dispute arises between you and HassanAndAssociates regarding our handling of your User Personal Information, we will do our best to resolve it.</p>

<p>HassanAndAssociates may disclose personally-identifying information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.</p>

<p>In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, HassanAndAssociates strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances.</p>

<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, HassanAndAssociates page may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will provide notification to Users of material changes to this Privacy Statement through our Website.</p>
